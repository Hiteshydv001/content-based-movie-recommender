=========================================

Overview
--------

The **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** is a machine learning model that recommends movies to users based on the similarity of movies they have liked or interacted with in the past. The model uses a movie's content features (such as genre, cast, director, and plot) to generate recommendations by calculating the similarity between different movies.

Features
--------

*   Recommends movies similar to the ones a user has liked.
    
*   Uses content features such as genres, plot descriptions, cast, crew, etc., to compare movies.
    
*   Supports multiple types of content feature extraction (text-based, metadata-based).
    
*   Fast and scalable using vectorization and similarity measures.
    
*   Can be integrated into various platforms like websites or applications.
    

Tech Stack
----------

*   **Python**: Core programming language for building the system.
    
*   **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
    
*   **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
    
*   **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
    
*   **TfidfVectorizer**: For converting movie plots and descriptions into feature vectors.
    
*   **Cosine Similarity**: For calculating the similarity between movies based on feature vectors.
    

Setup
-----

### 1\. Clone the Repository

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/content-based-movie-recommendation.git  
 cd content-based-movie-recommendation`

### 2\. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed. 

### 3\. Dataset

You will need a dataset of movies with features like title, genres, director, actors, and plot description. You can use the **TMDB Movie Dataset** or any other movie dataset.

Ensure that the dataset is in a CSV format and placed in the data/ folder, or update the path to the dataset in the code.

### 4\. Run the Application

Once everything is set up, you can run the movie recommendation script:

`python app.py`

Usage
-----

### 1\. Input

The system takes a movie title as input from the user. The model then finds the movie in the dataset and generates a list of similar movies.

### 2\. Recommendation

After identifying the movie, the model computes similarity scores between this movie and all others in the dataset. Based on these scores, the system provides a ranked list of recommended movies.

### Example

`movie_title = "Inception"  recommendations = recommend_movies(movie_title)  print(recommendations)`

### Output

The system outputs a list of top N recommended movies, where N can be configured.

`Recommendations for 'Inception':  1. Interstellar  2. The Matrix  3. Shutter Island  4. The Prestige  5. Memento`

Customization
-------------

*   **Number of recommendations**: You can change the number of movies recommended by modifying the recommend() function.
    
*   **Content features**: You can add or remove features like cast, director, etc., by modifying the feature extraction process.
    
*   **Similarity metric**: By default, cosine similarity is used, but you can experiment with other metrics like Euclidean distance or Pearson correlation.
    

Future Improvements
-------------------

*   Incorporate user ratings and feedback for hybrid recommendations.
    
*   Implement collaborative filtering alongside content-based filtering.
    
*   Add support for more advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as word embeddings, for plot comparison.
